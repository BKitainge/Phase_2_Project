# Problem Statement
The business problem the client is facing is how to create a successful platform for buying and selling houses in King County. To achieve this goal, the platform needs to provide accurate estimates of house prices, which is crucial for both buyers and sellers.

To accomplish this, the client wants to use a model that can infer the most important features that determine house prices in King County. These features might include factors such as the location of the house, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, the size of the house, and other relevant factors.

The model needs to be trained on data that accurately represents the real estate market in King County, including historical sales data, current property listings, and other relevant data sources. By using this data, the model can learn to accurately estimate the value of a house based on its features.

Once the model is trained, it can be integrated into the platform to provide buyers and sellers with accurate estimates of house prices, which can help them make informed decisions about buying or selling a property. By providing a reliable and accurate platform for buying and selling houses in King County, the client can establish themselves as a leader in the local real estate market and attract a large and loyal customer base. 


### Project Objectives 
* To identify the key features that significantly influence house prices in King County.
* To develop a model that accurately estimates house prices based on the identified features.
* To evaluate the performance of the developed model in estimating house prices in King County.

# Data Understanding 
1. Data
